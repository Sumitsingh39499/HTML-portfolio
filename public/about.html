<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>i am a highly motivated and disciplined individual, currently pursuing your BTech in your 2nd year, 4th semester at Rungta College. My routine shows a strong balance between academics, self-development, and physical fitness. I am deeply committed to my growth — academically, I am actively strengthening your skills in Python, Data Structures & Algorithms, web development, and data analysis. I have taken initiatives like completing Mosh Hamedani’s Python course, working on personal projects like MY-WALLET, and following structured learning programs such as the GFG 160 Days DSA challenge and Angela Yu’s web development course.</p>

<p>Fitness is also a major part of my lifestyle. I maintain a consistent gym routine, fueled by a simple and nutritious vegetarian diet, and I even supplement my workouts smartly with whey protein and L-arginine. My mornings are filled with focused energy, and I use tools like my Fire-Boltt smartwatch to stay on track. I am not just working hard in the present — I am also building a strong resume for the future, with clear goals like securing a remote coding internship and contributing meaningful projects to your portfolio.</p>

<p>Beyond technical and fitness goals, I show a genuine curiosity and a love for learning. Whether it’s writing abstracts on trending topics in computer science or participating in activities like NSS, I have a spirit that seeks constant improvement and contribution. I understand the importance of balancing work and rest, ensuring at least 6.5 hours of sleep to stay energized and focused.

  In short, I am someone who embodies dedication, curiosity, discipline, and ambition — steadily building the foundation for a successful and fulfilling career.</p>
